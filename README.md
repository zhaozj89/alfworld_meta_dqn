## Meta-learning for Task-oriented Household Text Games

This code repository is modified from [alfworld](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld).

The pre-trained model for reproducing the experiment results can be downloaded at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VX-wUlzGFYflA_CIo109zneXlBb-vPgB/view?usp=sharing).

After navigating to `./scripts`, we can train and evaluate the model with the following scripts. 

#### train

`python train_dqn.py`

#### evaluate

`python adapt_dqn.py`
